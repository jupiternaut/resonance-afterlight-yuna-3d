# YUNA v9 Project State

## Current State

- `CharacterPackage/semantic_layer_v8` is the immutable visual-review / DCC
  baseline.
- v9 actuator routes exist for weapon, boots, legs, and authored hair ribbons.
- Weapon, boot, and leg routes are additive candidates/proxies; they do not
  replace v8 beauty.
- `authored_hair_ribbons_v0` generated assets and fixed the black-alpha leak,
  but it is rejected as a clean hair candidate.
- Hair coordinate alignment is only a weak pass against the dirty v8 hair union.
- Clean/refined hair target checks still fail:
  - current status: `failed_target_schema_alignment`
  - current candidate is not accepted as hair-only
  - `ready_for_cloth_seam_surface=false`
- `hair_target_schema_v1` now exists with `strict_hair_core`,
  `soft_hair_silhouette`, and `forbidden_nonhair_zone`.
- The v1 schema is ready for a ribbon rebuild, but the current candidate fails
  against it:
  - `forbidden_candidate_leak_ratio=0.975006`
  - `candidate_core_coverage_ratio=0.041425`
  - `candidate_soft_inside_ratio=0.021113`
- `cloth_seam_surface` remains blocked.

## Current Blocker

Fix or rebuild authored hair ribbons against `hair_target_schema_v1` before any
new actuator work. The target schema now separates real hair evidence from body,
face, weapon, cloth, leg, boot, and cape contamination; the existing candidate
does not satisfy it.

## Formula Binding

The v9/v10 candidate loop is governed by the Bounded Semantic Geometry Filter:

```text
theta_p_next =
ProjectToConstraints_p(
  (1 - alpha) * theta_p
  + alpha * RobustFuse(
      front_obs_p,
      side_obs_p,
      back_obs_p,
      validation_obs_p,
      prior_p
    )
)
```

In this project, `theta_p` means part-generator parameters, target masks,
metadata, route status, and validation fields before it means raw vertices.
`ProjectToConstraints_p` must keep v8 immutable, preserve front identity, keep
side/back soft, preserve beauty/cage separation, keep
`replace_in_beauty_glb=false` by default, and reject candidates that fail visual
sanity or target-schema gates.

## Current Hair Formula Binding

For the hair route, do not treat one mask IoU as success. The current update
target is not:

```text
candidate ~= raw_hair_union
```

The current update target is:

```text
candidate_hair_next =
ProjectToConstraints_hair(
  RobustFuse(
    strict_hair_core,
    soft_hair_silhouette,
    forbidden_nonhair_zone,
    front_identity,
    manual_visual_review
  )
)
```

Current blocker:

- raw hair union is dirty;
- strict clean target is too narrow;
- refined component-prior target is still not final;
- `hair_target_schema_v1` is available;
- current candidate leaks into the forbidden nonhair zone;
- `cloth_seam_surface` remains blocked.

Next valid task: `fix_hair_ribbons_to_schema_v1` or
`build_art_directed_hair_ribbons_v1`.

Invalid next task: `cloth_seam_surface`.

## Do Not Do

- Do not proceed to `cloth_seam_surface`.
- Do not accept raw/refined union IoU as final proof of hair quality.
- Do not replace v8 beauty.
- Do not call hair v0 accepted until target-schema checks and manual review pass.

## Required Verification

For implementation turns, run the narrowest relevant tests plus:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s CharacterPackage/tools/tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
python3 -m compileall CharacterPackage/tools
git diff --name-only -- CharacterPackage/semantic_layer_v8
```
